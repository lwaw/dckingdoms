Dckingdoms is a discord bot written in python to transform your discord
server into a kingdoms server. This bot allows users to create kingdoms
and regions which can then be joined by users of the discord server.
Kings can decide to attack regions that are part of other kingdoms.
Players can train and work every hour to gain strength and workpower.
Strength can be used in a battle by each user to deal damage and
workpower can be used by kings to deal damage.

This bot stores discrord user id's of people that participate in the
game. At anytime players can quit the game and the user id will then be
removed from the database.

The following commands are available:

All commands start with "-dck"
